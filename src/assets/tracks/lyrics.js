                "2012 was nothing serious",
                "I know we caught the feels, it got really real",
                "Too good to be true, I guess I thought you was, yeah",
                "Why did I run away, run away, run away?",
                "Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything",
                "I know it's gettin' late, gettin' late, gettin' late",
                "But can I still be on my way, on my way? Yeah",
                "I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too",
                "But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you",
                "I thought that I'd be better when I found someone new",
                "But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you",
                "Baby now, oh-oh-oh",

                "But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you",
                "Thought I could get you back any time of day",
                "Shouldn't have been so cocky",
                "Shouldn't have did you wrong (woah, oh)",
                "And now I miss you bad, really, really bad",
                "Guess you don't know what you got until it's gone",
                "Why did I run away, run away, run away? (Run away)",
                "Oh, your love was everything, everything, everything (everything)",

                "But when I touch her I feel like I'm cheating on you",
                "Baby, no",
                "There ain't no lips like your lips",
                "And nobody else feels like this",
                "There's no moving on, I'll admit",
                "If you go away",
                "Yeah, ah",
                "I know I said goodbye and baby, you said it too",
